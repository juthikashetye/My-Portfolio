        <p>Hi, I'm Juthika, a modern magician, except I transform complicated technical ideas into user-friendly images before your eyes! You can also call me a Web Developer. Welcome to my website.</p>

        <p>I am currently learning the tricks of the trade i.e. Full Stack Web Development at UC Berkeley, Extension in San Francisco, California.</p>

        <p>I love coding and believe in producing high-quality content that meets your objectives and best fits your unique identity.</p>

         <p>My portfolio showcases a lineup of my most recent tricks, which range from fun games to useful applications and are built using the latest conventions and best practices in coding. I am proficient in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Materialize, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, MySQL and can also work with MongoDB, React.js and Firebase.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m always ready for new challenges and have plenty of room up my sleeve for a few volunteer opportunities.</p>

        <p>Check out my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> section to see the projects I have worked on so far and if you like my work then please feel free to connect with me. My contact details are provided in the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> section.</p>

        <p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
